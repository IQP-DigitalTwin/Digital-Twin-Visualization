## Getting Started

1. Create a `public/files/simulations` folder, so create a `simulations` folder there
2. Create a `.env` file in the root direction that is under `dt-dashboard-wpi`
3. Copy paste the `.env.template` into the `.env` without changing the addresses
4. You should be able to run `npm run dev` and it should run the server
5. Follow the steps and if you get a `fetch failed` in the simulation message that means there is a problem with the connection between the frontend and backend


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
